In Java, a record is a special type of class declaration aimed at reducing the boilerplate code.
Java records were introduced with the intention to be used as a fast way to create
data carrier classes, i.e. the classes whose objective is to simply contain data and carry it between modules,
 also known as POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
 Record was introduced in Java SE 14 as a preview feature, which is a feature whose design,
 implementation, and specification are complete but it is not a permanent addition to the language,
 which means that the feature may or may not exist in the future versions of the language.
 Java SE 15 extends the preview feature with additional capabilities such as local record classes.
