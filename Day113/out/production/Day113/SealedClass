sealed class.

It is a preview feature.

Java sealed classes and interfaces restrict that which classes and interfaces may extend or implement them.

In other words, we can say that the class that cannot be inherited but can be instantiated is known as the sealed class.

It allows classes and interfaces to have more control over their permitted subtypes.

It is useful both for general domain modeling and for building a more secure platform for libraries.

Note that the concept of sealed classes is a preview feature, not a permanent feature.
