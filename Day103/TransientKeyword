Transient keyword is a variable modifier which is used in the context of Serialization in Java.

Serialization is a process of converting an object state into some file which can be saved in a hard disk drive rather than the main memory.

Let's take an example of an object where we have some confidential data in a variable.

While serialization we don't want the confidential data to be saved on hard disk in the process of serialization.

So here the Transient Keyword in Java is used along with the variable to avoid serialization of that particular variable.
